## Git Flight Rules ##

 1. Resolving current Index
	 
	 Errors: 
	  - needs merge
	  - you need to resolve your current index first   
    Resolution:
       - If want to revert back
          [git reset --merge ](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6006737/git-merge-errors)
       - [Resolve merge conflict](http://schacon.github.io/git/user-manual.html#resolving-a-merge)
